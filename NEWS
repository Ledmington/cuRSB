 - small fixes in internal debugging features
 - small fixes in rsbench

   could crash on uniform-values matrix input.
 - fix: BLAS_ussp() of RSB extension properties now effective
 - fix: rsb_mtx_get_vec(... , ... , RSB_EXTF_SUMS_ROW)) and
        rsb_mtx_get_vec(... , ... , RSB_EXTF_SUMS_COL)) were missing a
        recursive implementation, and crashing (segmentation fault).

   -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1 to circumvent its C99 incompatibilities.
 - fix: previously, code was broken in case of lack of all of
   --enable-allocator-wrapper, posix_memalign() and memalign(); 
   now malloc() will be used instead.
 - fix: memory hierarchy info string set via --with-memhinfo used to be
   ignored by an eventual auto-detected value, wrongly.

 librsb Version 1.2.0-rc4 (20160805), changes:
 - librsb-config will print a space between each emitted item and
   explicitly the static library file path on --static
 - fix: rsbench -M was requesting wrong alignment from posix_memalign
 - internally using libtool for everything:

           (ussm not affected)

   ( mtxAp != NULL && mtxOpp != NULL ) rather than on
   ( mtxAp != NULL && mtxOpp != NULL && *mtxOpp != NULL ).
 - Will use memset() on systems with no bzero() (e.g. mingw).

 librsb Version 1.2.0-rc2 (20151025), changes:

  * fewer compile time warnings from automatically generated code, e.g. in
    rsb_krnl.c and rsb_libspblas.c

  * bugfix w.r.t. 1.1: usmm()/ussm() were not declared in rsb_blas_sparse.F90
  * introduced extension BLAS property blas_rsb_autotune_next_operation
    to trigger auto tuning at the next usmv/usmm call
  * eliminated RSB_FLAG_RECURSIVE_DOUBLE_DETECTED_CACHE and
               RSB_FLAG_RECURSIVE_HALF_DETECTED_CACHE
  * rsb_load_spblas_matrix_file_as_matrix_market() now takes a
    typecode argument. Sets either blas_upper_triangular,
    blas_lower_triangular, blas_upper_hermitian, blas_lower_hermitian,
    blas_upper_symmetric or blas_lower_symmetric property according to
    the loaded file.
  * properly using INTEGER(C_SIGNED_CHAR) for 'typecode' arguments in rsb.F90.
  * rsb.F90 change: all interfaces to functions taking INTEGER arrays now
    require them to be declared as TARGET and passed as pointer
    (via C_LOC()), just as e.g. VA.
  * introduced the RSB_MARF_EPS_L flag for rendering Encapsulated PostScript
    (EPS) matrices (with rsb_mtx_rndr()) and having a label included
 - functionality changes: 
  * if called after uscr_end, uscr_insert_entries (and similar) will either
    add/overwrite, according to whether the blas_rsb_duplicates_ovw or 
    blas_rsb_duplicates_sum property has been set just after uscr_end;
    default is blas_rsb_duplicates_ovw.
  * if configured without memory wrapper, requests for

  * non-square sparse-sparse matrices multiply (rsb_spmsp) and sum
    (rsb_sppsp) had wrong conformance check and potential off-limits
    writes

    the Sparse BLAS standard
  * rsb_mtx_clone(): alphap now uses source matrix typecode
  * rsb_util_sort_row_major_bucket_based_parallel() bugfix
  * RSB_IO_WANT_VERBOSE_TUNING used to depend on RSB_WANT_ALLOCATOR_LIMITS
 - rsbench (librsb benchmarking program (internals)) changes:
  * --incx and --incy now accept lists of integers; e.g. "1" or "1,2,4"
  * rsb_mtx_get_rows_sparse() was not handling RSB_TRANSPOSITION_C and
    RSB_TRANSPOSITION_T correctly until 1.1-rc2. Fixed now.
  * added --only-upper-triangle
  * if unspecified, default --alpha and beta now are set to 1.0
  * when using --incx and --incy with list arguments, with
    --one-nonunit-incx-incy-nrhs-per-type rsbench will skip benchmarking
    combinations with both incX and incY > 1
  * --also-transpose will skip transposed multiply of symmetric matrices
  * --no-want-ancillary-execs is now default
  * in an auto-tuning scan --impatient will print partial performance results
    and update the performance results frequently.
  * small fix in ancillary (--want-ancillary-execs) time measurements
  * --types is a new alias for --type, and 'all' for ':' (all configured types)
  * will tolerate non-existing or unreadable matrix files by just skipping them
  * --reuse-io-arrays is now default (see --no-reuse-io-arrays to disable this)
    and will avoid repeated file loading for the same matrix.
  * --want-mkl-autotune 0/1 will disable/enable MKL autotuning in addition to
    the RSB autotuning experiment.
  * added:
     --skip-loading-if-matching-regex
     --skip-loading-symmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-unsymmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-hermitian-matrices
     --skip-loading-not-unsymmetric-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-more-nnz-matrices 
     --skip-loading-if-less-nnz-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-more-filesize-kb-matrices
     --skip-loading-if-matching-regex and --skip-loading-if-matching-substr
  * if -n <threads> unspecified, will use omp_get_max_threads()
    to determine the threads count.
  * will terminate gracefully after SIGINT (CTRL-c from the keyboard)
  * producing performance record files with
      --write-performance-record <file>
    ( '' will ask for an automatically generated file name)
  * reading back performance record files with --read-performance-record
  * writing no performance record file with --write-no-performance-record
  * --max-runtime will make the program terminate gracefully after a specified 
    maximal amount of time
  * rsbench: LaTeX output of performance records; see options
    --write-performance-record and --read-performance-record

  * configure option --enable-rsb-num-threads enables the user to specify
    desired rsb_spmv/rsb_spmm threads count (if >0) via the RSB_NUM_THREADS
    environment variable; even the value specified via
    RSB_IO_WANT_EXECUTING_THREADS will be overridden.

  * deprecated rsb_mtx_get_norm for rsb_mtx_get_nrm.
  * deprecated rsb_mtx_upd_values for rsb_mtx_upd_vals.

    RSB_REINIT_SINGLE_VALUE_GET.
  * introduced an ISO-C-BINDING interface to rsb.h (rsb.F03): consequently,
    the --disable-fortran-interface configure option is now unnecessary, and
    fortran programs can use rsb_lib_exit/rsb_lib_init instead of
    rsb_lib_exit_np/rsb_lib_init_np.
  * significantly improved documentation.
  * --enable-librsb-stats configure option will enable collection of time

    --enable-zero-division-checks-on-solve.
  * rsb.mod will be optionally installed (separate from blas_sparse.mod).

  * improved performance of multi-vector multiplication
    (leaf matrices will step once in each multi-vector).
  * introduced rsb_mtx_rndr for rendering matrix structures to files.
  * now using parallel scaling of output vector in Y <- beta Y + .. operations.
  * extensions for handling duplicates in the sparse blas interface:
    blas_rsb_duplicates_ovw, blas_rsb_duplicates_sum.

  * debug option to limit count and volume of memory allocations, with
    RSB_IO_WANT_MAX_MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS and RSB_IO_WANT_MAX_MEMORY_ALLOCATED
    (depending on --enable-allocator-wrapper).
  * configure switch to select maximal threads count (--with-max-threads).
  * <rsb-types.h> renamed to <rsb_types.h>.
  * each librsb source file is prefixed by 'rsb' (less probability of object
    file name clash in large applications).
  * RSB_IO_* macros are now declared as enum rsb_opt_t.
  * Doxygen will be only invoked to build documentation if configure switch 
    --enable-doc-build has been enabled.
  * RSB_IO_WANT_EXTRA_VERBOSE_INTERFACE has been extended to Sparse BLAS
    interface to librsb.
  * Changes pertaining only the rsbench benchmark program:
   * rsbench benchmarks data-footprint equivalent GEMV and GEMM.
   * --read-as-binary/--write-as-binary options to rsbench (not yet in rsb.h).
   * --discard-read-zeros option to rsbench (to add RSB_FLAG_DISCARD_ZEROS to
     the matrix flags).
   * --want-perf-counters option to rsbench (tested with PAPI 5.3; will enable
     additional rsb-originating performance counter statistics to be dumped).
   * zero-dimensioned matrices are allowed.
   * changed row pointers parameter of rsb_mtx_alloc_from_csr_inplace to
     rsb_nnz_idx_t*. 
   * PostScript (RSB_MARF_EPS, RSB_MARF_EPS_S, RSB_MARF_EPS_B) dump with
     rsb_mtx_rndr are more compact now
   * to enable or disable openmp, use either --enable-openmp or --disable-openmp
